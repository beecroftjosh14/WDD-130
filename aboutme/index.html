    <h2>Josh Beecroft</h2>
    <p>Hey everyone! My name is Josh Beecroft and I'm 22 years old. I live in Mesa Arizona with my twin brother and I am currently working as a pool technician with Morris Pools. Some of the things I enjoy doing is playing sports, reading, and playing video games. </p>
    <p>As of right now I am pursing a Bachelor's degree in Applied Technology. I'm very interested in web design so I'm excited to have the opportunity to take this class and increase my knowledge on the subject.</p>
    <p>I have also been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for my whole life. My favorite scripture is Psalm 23. Thanks for reading this an I'm excited to get to know everyone.</p>
